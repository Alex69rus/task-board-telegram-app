# Task Board Telegram Mini App

It is a collaborative task board for Telegram groups from scratch. 
We will do:
- Set up a Next.js project with TypeScript
- Integrate Firebase for real-time data management
- Deploy your Mini App to production
- Handle common pitfalls and their solutions

# Understanding the Project Scope
We’re building a task management system that allows Telegram group members to:
- Create and manage tasks together
- Track task completion status
- Delete completed tasks
- All in real-time, right within Telegram

# Project architecture:
-  platform: Telegram Mini App
- back-end: NEXT.JS
- front-end: server-side rendering via NEXT.JS
- database: Firebase

1. Telegram Mini App serves as the entry point for users, providing seamless integration with Telegram’s native interface. It offers direct access to the web app features, allowing users to interact with the application without leaving the Telegram environment.
2. Next.js Web App is the core of our application, handling the main application logic with server-side rendering capabilities. Built with TypeScript for enhanced maintainability, it provides the full feature set and manages all user interactions.
3. Firebase acts as our central data management system, providing real-time database capabilities and handling authentication. It ensures data synchronization across all components and offers robust cloud functions for backend operations.
4. Telegram Bot manages automated notifications and handles direct communication with Firebase. It processes commands and provides additional functionality through the Telegram bot interface, complementing the Mini App experience.
